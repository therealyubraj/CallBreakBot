Bidding:
make a NN that can bid and feed in data ourselves

input will be a 52 sized array where 13 will be activated if the card is present in the deck
the input will be in CHSD order.
[1C, 2C, ..., 13C, 1H, 2H, ..., 13H, 1S, 2S, ..., 13S, 1D, 2D, ..., 13D]
if our deck contains 1C, then, 1C = 0 else 0.

feed this into NN and then the output is the bid value.

the output is also an array of 8 size.
the index containing highest value is the bid.

or
make a heuristical guess?

possible heuristsics:

certain combination of cards: Ace and king, 10 and king, queen and king
certain cards: Ace, king, etc.
number of cards of a suit: we can play trump and win if our cards run out, number of trump cards,
sure fire cards: ace of spade
