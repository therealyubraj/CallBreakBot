Bidding:
make a NN that can bid and feed in data ourselves

input will be a 52 sized array where 13 will be activated if the card is present in the deck
the input will be in CHSD order.
[1C, 2C, ..., 13C, 1H, 2H, ..., 13H, 1S, 2S, ..., 13S, 1D, 2D, ..., 13D]
if our deck contains 1C, then, 1C = 0 else 0.

feed this into NN and then the output is the bid value.

the output is also an array of 8 size.
the index containing highest value is the bid.

or
make a heuristical guess?

possible heuristsics:

certain combination of cards: Ace and king, 10 and king, queen and king
certain cards: Ace, king, etc.
number of cards of a suit: we can play trump and win if our cards run out, number of trump cards,
sure fire cards: ace of spade


Playing:

problems:
we dont know each other's cards

strategies:

possible playable cards:
say the card initially played is 2H:
then check if we have any hearts:
	if there are hearts in our deck:
		check if any card is higher value than the card.
			if any card is higher:
				check if it is worth it to play the highest card
					if it is woth it to play the highest card: play it.
				not worth it: play the lowest highest card.
		if no card is higher: play the lowest card.
if no hearts then:
	play appropriate trump card for the situation (needs to be explained further)
if no trump as well(shit hit the fan):
	play the lowest possible card of any suit.
